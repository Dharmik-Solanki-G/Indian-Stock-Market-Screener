    "ai_explanation": "The provided trading strategy is called \"Oversold RSI with Rising Volume.\" Here's a breakdown of the conditions in plain English:\n\n1. **RSI (Relative Strength Index) < 30**: This condition looks for stocks that are considered oversold, meaning they have experienced a significant price decline over a certain period (in this case, 14 days). When a stock is oversold, it may be undervalued and could potentially rebound.\n\n2. **Volume > Volume (5-day moving average)**: This condition looks for stocks with increasing volume over the past 5 days compared to their average daily trading volume during that same period. An increase in volume indicates a higher level of buying or selling activity, which can signal that institutions or large investors are accumulating shares or dumping them, respectively.\n\n3. **Close > 0**: This condition ensures that only stocks with positive closing prices are considered for the strategy. In other words, it filters out any stocks that have experienced a price drop to zero or below.\n\nOverall, this strategy is designed to identify oversold stocks that are showing signs of accumulation by institutional investors, which could indicate a potential rebound in their prices. By combining these conditions, the strategy aims to help investors find undervalued stocks with strong buying interest."
